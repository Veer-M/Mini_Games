## Game Descriptions

**BlackJack**

In the BlackJack game, you play against an automated dealer called Jonathan. The objective is to get a hand with a higher value than the dealer's without going over 21. You can choose between easy, medium, or hard difficulty levels.

**Hangman**

Hangman is a word guessing game. You need to guess the letters of a hidden word by inputting single characters. For each incorrect guess, a part of a stick figure (representing a hanged person) is drawn. You have a limited number of turns to guess the word correctly.

**Tic-Tac-Toe**

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking X or O in an empty cell. The objective is to have three marks in a row, column, or diagonal. The numerical values are displayed for each section of the grid to help you make your move.

**Pac-Man**

Pac-Man is a simplified version of the classic arcade game. You control Pac-Man using the arrow keys and try to eat all the dots while avoiding the ghosts. Your score increases with each dot eaten. Be careful not to collide with the ghosts, or you'll lose a life.

Have fun playing these Python mini games!
